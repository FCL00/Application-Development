# Local Development Setup

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

Step 1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node installed. If not head over to https://nodejs.org/en/download to download the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.
To check the version terminal:

```
node --version
```

Step 2. Make sure you have the latest version of VSCode installed. If not, head over to https://code.visualstudio.com/download to download the version for your platform.

Step 3. Open a Terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project.

Step 4. Create a Vite app by running the following command in your Terminal or Command Prompt:

```
npm create vite@latest .
npm create vite@latest project-name

// slower download
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```
