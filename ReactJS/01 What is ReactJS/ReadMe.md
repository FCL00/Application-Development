# What is ReactJS?

So what is React, and why exactly would you use it? Well, if we visit the <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">official webpage</a>, we get an answer. `It's a library for web and native user interfaces.`

And as it turns out, it's a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. But that of course, still doesn't answer the other question Why would you use it?

# Why would you use it?

if you visit a webpage that uses React, like, for example,
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/ph-en/" target="_blank">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>,
<a href="https://www.zillow.com" target="_blank">Zillow</a>.
As you navigate around on such a website, you'll see that all these transitions are super smooth, pretty much instant, and you never have this effect where you seem to load a new page. So where you seem to wait for a new page to be sent back by the server. To some extent, it therefore feels like a mobile app, because in mobile apps, getting instant feedback and having smooth transitions is pretty much the standard. And it's libraries like React that help us build such user experiences, such user interfaces for the web as well.
