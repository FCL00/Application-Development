# Imperative Programming | Directing Every Step

Imperative programming, the hallmark of traditional JavaScript development, is akin to providing a detailed manual for accomplishing a task. With imperative code, developers meticulously instruct the program on each step required to achieve the desired outcome. Whether it's manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling user interactions, or managing application state, imperative code leaves no stone unturned in its quest for control.

# Declarative Programming | Describing Desired Outcomes

In contrast, declarative programming, championed by React.js, adopts a different approach. Rather than spelling out every individual step, declarative code focuses on describing the desired outcome. Developers specify what the UI should look like based on the current state, leaving the "how" to the framework. This paradigm shift abstracts away implementation details, fostering a more intuitive and maintainable development experience.
